# Bandai TCG Results List

This is a simple script to compile all your results from the Bandai TCG Plus app. This is a WIP.

## Disclaimer

Even though this script makes only one request per second and uses good practices, it is an *unauthorized* used of Bandai's API. Use it at your own risk, I'm not responsible if you get your bandai account banned.

## How to use

1. Clone this repo.

2. Install your dependencies (TODO: add dependencies)

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Duplicate the `.env.example` file and name it `.env`. Add your bearer token from the app. (You can check it in your `network` tab while using the app in your browser)

5. Run the script

```
python3 bandai_history.py
```

### Options

- Since this script saves every tournament as a json file under `events`, you can pass the `-s` flag after the first time to skip the events listing.

- You can pass a target with the flag `-t` to count only the results agains a single player:

```
python3 bandai_history.py -t XXXXXXXX
```

- You can pass the `-g` flag to group your results by opponents bandai id as well:

```
python3 bandai_history.py -g 
```

Optionally, you can add a file with the name "bandai_username_map.txt" to map your friend's bandai user id to their name. The file should have their names and ids in the following format:
```
FOO:XXXXXXXX
BAR:YYYYYYYY
BAZ:ZZZZZZZZ
```

- You can add a line with 'EVENTS_DIR_PATH' to save your events in a different folder (if you're running this script for a friend, for example)

## Project map

### Live app
- `*.html` — main entry pages (`index.html`, `analyzer.html`, `admin.html`, `login.html`, `profile.html`, `pending.html`).
- `js/` — browser logic and dashboard behavior.
- `css/` — shared styles.
- `icons/` — app icons and logo assets used at runtime.
- `Resources/player-picture/` — player photos used by rankings/profile views.
- `manifest.json` and `sw.js` — PWA manifest and service worker.
- `cards.json` — local card database consumed by the app.

### Backend / runtime
- `worker.js` and `cloudflare/` — Cloudflare Worker code and related config/history.
- `bandai_history.py`, `api_requests.py`, `tournament_data.py` — Python scripts used to fetch, process, and export tournament data.
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies for the scripts above.

### Local / generated only
- `events/` and `events_*/` — cached tournament payloads.
- `.wrangler/` — Wrangler local state and build cache.
- `__pycache__/` and `*.pyc` — Python bytecode caches.
- `results.xlsx` and `bandai_results.xlsx` — export outputs.
- `bandai_username_map.txt` — personal name map for local use.
- `.upload-state.json` — local upload helper snapshot used to detect changes.
- The upload staging folder is created outside the repo by default (in your temp directory) so it stays out of the project tree.


## Notes, Known Issues, TODOS:

- This script does not compute events with 0 rounds. This may cause a discrepancy in the total number of events and the sum of the results

- This script does not consider each game on your app individually
